// Boolean	bool	true/false

// Integer	int/uint	Signed and unsigned integers of varying sizes.

// Integer	int8 to int256	Signed int from 8 bits to 256 bits. int256 is same as int.

// Integer	uint8 to uint256	Unsigned int from 8 bits to 256 bits. uint256 is same as uint.

// Fixed Point Numbers	fixed/unfixed	Signed and unsigned fixed point numbers of varying sizes.

// Fixed Point Numbers	fixed/unfixed	Signed and unsigned fixed point numbers of varying sizes.

// Fixed Point Numbers	fixedMxN	Signed fixed point number where M represents number of bits taken by type and N represents the decimal points. M should be divisible by 8 and goes from 8 to 256. N can be from 0 to 80. fixed is same as fixed128x18.

// Fixed Point Numbers	ufixedMxN	Unsigned fixed point number where M represents number of bits taken by type and N represents the decimal points. M should be divisible by 8 and goes from 8 to 256. N can be from 0 to 80. ufixed is same as ufixed128x18.
